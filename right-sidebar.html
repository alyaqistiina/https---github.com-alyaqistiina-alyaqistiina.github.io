											<h2>Assignment 3: Report on Industry Talk 2</h2>
											<p><a href="images/Report on INDUSTRY TALK 2.pdf">Report PDF</a></li></p>
											
										</header>
										<p>
											On 28th of December, On May 3, Credence (TM Subsidiariy) hosted a presentation on System Development given by the knowledgeable 
											Ms. Qistina Azman. After this discussion, my class was given an assignment to do in our multiple groups. It was obvious that Ms. 
											Qistina Azman was passionate about what she was saying. Her status as an alumnae piques our curiosity in her speeches. 
											It's not common to come across successful individuals who attended the same school as you. Something that I took note was, she also experienced highs and lows 
											just like the rest of us students. But she stated that she did not give up iin the face of obstacles, instead striving to find the solution.
											
										</p>
										<p>
											Some of the topics covered in the talk was of course her profiles, her job scopes, Credence's environment, and technologies they used at Credence.
											This is the <a href="images/Report on INDUSTRY TALK 2.pdf"> pdf version of my group's report. </a>
											Based on her talk, she is clearly an expert on what she does and she is still learning. I have grown to admire her hardworks and resilience in always learning something new everyday.

											<h3>Improvement and Reflection 
												on Assignment 3
											</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											There's actually a few improvements can be done. The first couple minutes when the talk starts felt a little bit long.
											Students were told to join the Webex link on a specific time, but it was quiet a long time before the actual talk starts.
											This can be improved by telling the exact time the event starts instead of students having to wait a long time, because when I reviewed 
											the Webex recording of the talk, the actual talk was shorter than the waiting time.
										</p>
										<p>
											On the other hand, to summarize, this talk was a success in giving students an overview of what lies ahead in the future. 
											The talk has encouraged students to think and start planning early of their career path and their target company.
											By joining this talk, students have been informed well on knowledgeable skills and a good attitude an excellent students must have to achieve something great in life.

										<h2>Assignment 4: Newsletter on Industrial Talk 3 </h2>
										<p><a href="#">Newsletter PDF</a></li></p>
										
									</header>
									<p>
										On January 14th, at 1430, a discussion has been scheduled about a tech-driven innovation concentrating on business growth in urban agricultural solutions. The keynote speaker is none other than Dr. Seah Choon Sen, the top soccer startup in Malaysia. This discussion focused on how creative solutions are assisting customers, merchants, and retailers who are having difficulties with the conventional grocery supply. One of the few topics covered in the discussion was the advantages of this technology, both in terms of its social and economic effects. 

The session also covers a few other technologies, including machine learning and the Internet of Things (IoT). They assist in tracking the growth of plants and determine the best strategy for a smooth and healthy growth. 

										
									</p>
									<p>
										Additionally, Dr. Seah discussed a few previous and present problems related to the subject. One of the problems is that MCO is causing a lack of fresh veggies. Furthermore, due to the weight of the produce crates, some dealers were unable to carry them alone. This was a really entertaining and lively discussion. It inspires students to consider how technology might be used in the agricultural industry.
									In addition to that we have been assigned to create a Newsletter that discussed the topic on the talk. <a href="https://www.utm.my/">This is the PDF of the Newsletter. </a></p>

											<h3>Improvement and Reflection 
												on Assignment 4
											</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											There's little to none improvement need to be done on this particular talk. Both the conversation and the event function smoothly without a hitch.
										</p>
										<p>
											It was a lot of pleasure to hear Dr. Seah explain things. The interesting issue also captured the audience's attention. 
											 I thoroughly enjoyed the discussion and personally gained a lot of important knowledge.
