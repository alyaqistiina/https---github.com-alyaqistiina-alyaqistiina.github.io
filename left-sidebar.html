											<h3>Profile</h3>
										</header>
										<p>My full name is Alya Qistina binti Awaluddin. In 2022, I sat for the SPM examination at SMK Sultan Ismail, Johor. I resume my studies in physical science at Kolej Matrikulasi Negeri Sembilan following a three-month sabbatical. Although it was challenging to learn a lot of material in a short amount of time,
											 I succeeded and received a 4.00 cgpa. I was able to enroll at UTM, my ideal university, after taking an additional three months off! 
											Since it's only the first semester, I don't currently hold any prominent positions, but I look forward to participate in a lot more activities in the future. I currently am a member of Kelab Gamelan, and a crew in UTMHackaton and SUSKOM'23 events.

The five presenters included the chief technology officer, a QA test analyst, a junior Android developer, a junior UI/UX designer, and a junior web developer who had previously attended UTM. The first part of the discussion discusses how technology is always evolving and how breakthroughs in software, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence are affecting the globe. 
										</p>

												<h3>Advice I Learned:</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
											</p>
											<p>
												Some of the important skills I have learned during this talk was to have passion on whatever you do.
												
												The speaker underscores the importance of genuinely loving what you do. In the tech world, this translates to a passion for coding, problem-solving, and creating innovative solutions. It's not just about fulfilling job requirements but about being genuinely interested and excited about the work.
												Another advice given was to do a lot of self-learning.
												
												A key takeaway is the need to be a self-learner. In the ever-evolving tech landscape, waiting for someone to teach you is not an option. Those who proactively seek knowledge, learn independently, and stay updated are the ones who stand out. Continuous learning is the heartbeat of a successful career.

												<h3>Improvement and Reflection</h3>
											</header>
											<p>In essence, not much needs to be improved. All of the speakers' 
												delivers their speeches exceleently. They provide interest to the event and successfully captivate the audience's attention. 
												This was an extremely educative and insightful discussion.

						<h2>Assignment 2: Video on Visit to UTM Digital </h2>
						<p><a href="images/video_2024-01-23_02-12-46.mp4">Video </a></li></p>
					</header>
					<p>
						On 11th December, our class visited the UTM Digital as part of the activity in the syllibus. We visited the UTM Digital on a Monday morning
						and was greeted with the freindly staffs there. Some of the room we visited includes the smart classroom, their offices, and the most 
						exciting room is the one at the the lowest level. To enter this room, each student is required to leave our phone at the entrance as to
						ensure nobody takes any picture while were there. 
					</p>
					<p> All of us were quiet excited to do this program. We listen to the staffs talk intently. And as part of the assignments, 
						we were required to record videos and take the pictures of the inside of UTM Digital. We get to see how the staffs are working.
						In addition, we also were exposed on who takes care of the UTM Digital web, and also how Wifis are being handled in UTM. In the data room, where 
						we were not allowed to bring our phones, we learned that if any blackout of data happens, then UTMKL will take over.

							<h3>Improvement and Conclusion</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							I don't think there's anything to improve on this visit. Everything from the start to finish was very nice and I trust 
							everybody learned new things that day. We get to get to know with the staff. We also interviewed some of the staffs in regards
							 to our assignment. To conclude, this visit was very insightful and fun. It allows student to engange outside of the clasroom 
							 and learn something learned in theory being used in practical in real life.
