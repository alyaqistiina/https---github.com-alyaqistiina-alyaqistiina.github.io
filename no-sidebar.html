									<h2>PC Assemble</h2>
									<p></p>
								</header>
								<p>
									On 30th October, our class has been obligated to do a PC assembling. This activity was honestly quiet fun for me. I personally have 
									never seen inside of a PC and CPU. So, having seen one up close and getting the chance to reassemble it was very exciting. 
									My class did this activity on the morning so everybody was fresh. Before we started reassembling, the lecturer and staff gave us a breifing on what to do
									and what not to do. As expected, when dealing with delicate objects in the PC, we have to handle them gently. They also show us a step 
									by step on which one to take out first and which one to put in first. 
								</p>
								<p>
								After each group is done reassembling them, we would have to test and connect it to computer to see if it turns on. If it does turn on, then
								that means you have reassemble it correctly. If it's not, then you may have done something wrong. My group unfortunately did it uncorrectly. 
								But we tried reassembling once more, and fortunately when connected to the computer, it works! After all groups are done, we have to a quick quiz.
								The quiz was easy if you focus on the briefing. In a nutshell, this activity gave me a lot of new knowledge. For someone that don't know much about 
								PC, this activity has piques my interest in learning more about how a PC works.

												<h2>Design Thinking (Low Fidelity Project)</h2>
												<p></p>
											</header>
											<p>
												On 23th October, our lecturer has assigned us a task to create a design thinking project. This was also our first day of knowing 
												our group members. My group member consists of 3 men and 2 women. After this task was assigned, we discussed together first on what 
												product are we going to create. The first few meetings was difficult to organized because of difference in our members schedule, but we 
												succesfully manage to find the right time for everybody.
											</p>
											<p>
											We decided to a transportation application that combines all services in one app. Once we were done dividing task for everyone, it became easier to just discuss issue in the group chat. I was tasked with interviewing 
											users as well as finding problems and their wanted solutions. Others tasks also includes og making the user and driver interface, finding the backgrounds, and 
											organizing phases of our project. In addition to that, we also have to do a report, video, and presentation to sum up all the marks for this design thinking project.

													<h3>Our Product</h3>
												</header>
												<p>
													Honestly, it was a slow process because some internal problems between our group members, but in the end, we succesfully finish 
													all the tasks given. Our product offers a variety range of transportation for students in UTM that doesn't own their own transportation, 
													especially the first year students. So, our product aims to solve the problem by combining bus services, prebet service, and also carpooling.

													<h3>Improvement and Conclusion</h3>
												</header>
												<p>
													All in all, there's a lot to improve on my behalf as well as my groupmates. On the presentation day, our lecturer
													gave some useful feedbacks that we took note off. Dr. Azurah also pointed out some of our mistakes that we will
													definitely fix and upgrades in the future. Some of the things that I learned was teamwork is very important in having 
													a succesfull product. Every members must pull their own weight. Lastly, I learned that making any product is very hard. 
													Every product is the result of a high thinking skills and ability to solve a problem.
